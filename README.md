# lightpad

## about

*lightpad* is a SuperCollider 3 software for a multi-touch interface (a ROLI Lightpad) for fast, gestural improvisation with sound. The design is simple: the interface is divided into a grid and each quadrant of the grid corresponds to the beginning of a different instrument.


## dependencies

In addition to SuperCollider 3 this file assumes usage of Scott Cazan's [BlocksOSC](https://github.com/scazan/blocksosc).
